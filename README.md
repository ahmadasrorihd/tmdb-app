# tmdb-app
A sample to showcase Kotlin, MVVM, Paging, Room, Koin, Coroutines, Retrofit, DataBinding and Unit test.

## Features
* MVVM Architecture + Repository design Pattern.
* Jetpack Libraries and Architecture Components.

## Testing
Local unit testing is done for ViewModel layers.

## Libraries
* [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
   * [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging) Library helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time. Loading partial data on demand reduces usage of network bandwidth and system resources.
   * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) ViewModel is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. This allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
   * [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) is a Library in the support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
   * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components updating app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.
   * [Room] (https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) is an image loading and caching library for Android.
* [Kotlin coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) Executing code asynchronously.
* [StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) is a state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates to its collectors.
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) is a Type-safe HTTP client for Android, Java and Kotlin by Square.
* [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) is a serialization/deserialization library to convert objects into JSON and back.
* [OkHttp interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor) Logs HTTP requests and responses.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/) Build beautiful, usable products using Material Components for Android.
* [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) which is the most popular Mocking framework for unit tests written in Java as well as Kotlin.
* [MockK](https://mockk.io/ANDROID.html) mocking library for Kotlin
* [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso) Automated testing UI test
